# HIVYE
HIV Youth Empowerment App

### Note

This project is based on [HIVYE](https://github.com/emmanuel-joseph-22/HIVYE-in-vue-cli.git).  I decided to revise the whole project which involved a lot of refactoring from the code structure and logic and some UI remodeling, while keeping some important codes including risk estimator script and existing api's with database. When it comes to code styles, the project uses a mix of options API and composition API which wasn't initially intended. I am still trying to get used to the newer style which I really don't like. This version migrated to Vite due to vue-cli being deprecated, implemented tailwind, and added pinia for state management. Special thanks to original contributors.
