# HIVYE 
07-19-24
This project is based on [HIVYE](https://github.com/AaronVillano/Mobile_Application.git).  I decided to revise the whole project which involved a lot of refactoring and UI remodeling, while keeping some important components including risk estimator component. 

I kept firebase for database and cloud service. This vue project is built in Vite and I added state management using Pinia.

When it comes to code styles, the project uses a mix of options API and composition API which wasn't initially intended. I am still trying to get used to the newer style which I really don't like.

I also built a mobile version in android. Will try to build for iOS soon.

## Project Setup
```
npm i
npm run dev
npm run build
```
