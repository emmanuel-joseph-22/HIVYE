# HIVYE 
07-19-24
This project is based on [HIVYE](https://github.com/AaronVillano/Mobile_Application.git).  I decided to revise the whole project which involved a lot of refactoring and UI remodeling, while keeping some important components including risk estimator component. 

I kept firebase for database and cloud service. I migrated with Vite from vue-cli and added state management using Pinia. When it comes to code styles, the project uses a mix of options API and composition API which wasn't initially intended.

## Known bugs and ongoing development
